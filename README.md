# Phishing Email Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing a sample phishing email to identify common phishing characteristics. The goal is to understand how to detect phishing attempts by examining various aspects of a suspicious email.

## Objective
Identify phishing traits in a suspicious email sample by analyzing the sender, headers, content, links, and language.

## What I Did
- Obtained a sample phishing email from public resources.
- Examined the sender’s email address for spoofing signs.
- Analyzed email headers using an online header analyzer to detect inconsistencies.
- Identified suspicious links and attachments within the email.
- Looked for urgent or threatening language designed to prompt quick action.
- Noted any mismatched URLs by hovering over links.
- Verified the presence of spelling and grammar errors.
- Summarized all phishing indicators found in a detailed report.

## Tools Used
- Email client / saved email text file
- Online email header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox, Google header analyzer)

## Deliverables
- `phishing_email_sample.eml` — sample phishing email file
- `header_analysis.txt` — results from header inspection
- `screenshots/` — screenshots of header analyzer results and suspicious links
- `phishing_report.md` — detailed report listing all phishing indicators identified

## How to Use
1. Open the phishing email sample in a text editor or email client.
2. Review the sender's address and email headers.
3. Use an online header analyzer to check for discrepancies.
4. Inspect links and attachments carefully.
5. Read through the email body looking for phishing language and errors.
6. Refer to the `phishing_report.md` for a summary of findings.
